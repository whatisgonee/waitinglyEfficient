			text = `Part I

The office was buzzing with life. Today was a busy day, the company has taken on a new project and a lot of paperwork had to be done. Clicking and clacking, ringing of phones were all the things Emily Parkins was used to. She was taking a break near a cooler on the second floor, even though there was another right next to her workplace. On the second floor was the technical department where Josh Huston, Emily's colleague was working. Emily did not like him, but neither did she dislike him. He was just attractive, that's all. Josh's personality, however, was not the best. Describing it in one word - a jerk.
Emily looked at her watch and headed down to the stairs. She sat down at her desk and continued filling out the financial tables. A few minutes passed and Emily felt a little bit sleepy. Then, that feeling overtook all of her thoughts and she started dozing off. Quite soon, Emily Parkins was asleep at her table and no one noticed.

Emily woke up and looked around the place. Her computer was still on, so she must have slept for a few minutes. One thing was different though. There was no one in the office. The usual sounds of the busy workday have dissappeared. How long has she really slept?
She stood up and walked around. All the cubicles were empty, the employees missing. Emily started calling out names of her colleagues, but no one replied. She decided to check the second floor, there was a meeting room there. Still, after she checked everywhere, there was no one and Emily felt a bit of fear. The overwhelming feeling which she often experienced started taking roots and a few minutes later, Emily was having a panic attack. She was sitting on the floor, trying to calm herself down, when someone gently touched her shoulder. She flinched and turned around. A woman, who Emily often saw here and there, was standing behind her. It was the janitor, a really nice, old lady with curly, red hair. Despite often greeting the woman, Emily did not know her name.
"Are you alright my dear?" asked the woman in a sweet voice. In spite of the old age, the woman seemed to be filled with energy. She also often smiled and laughed which Emily did not expect from a person whom many people around the office ignore.
"Yes, thank you," answered Emily and stood up. The feeling of fear and panic retreated and she felt much better.
"May I ask you," started Emily.
"Sure," interrupted her the lady, cutting Emily off mid-sentence. Emily stopped for a second and then continued.
"What's your name?"
"You know it," mysteriously answered the woman. Emily was flustered by that response and tried again to which she was given the same response.
"What do you mean?" asked Emily, as both women were walking down the empty hallway. Emily had a habbit of walking whenever she was deep in thoughts.
"I mean it," answered the lady, "You know my name. You just have to try to remember it."
Emily followed her advice and concentrated with all her power. She remember having conversation with her about a week ago. They accidentally stumbled into each other and the woman helped Emily pick up all the papers. They had a quick chat and went their own ways. At that moment, something clicked in Emily's head.
"Mary," started Emily with uncertainty. The woman nodded in reassurence.
"mary Hunt!" excitedly said Emily and the woman smiled.
"That's right," said Mary and the two women entered the elevator.
"Where's everyone?" asked Emily while the elevator slowly glided upwards onto the top floor.
"No," Mary shook her head. "The question is, where you are."
Emily looked at her companion with confusion. 
"You, Emily," answered Mary, "Are dreaming."
The elevator dinged and the doors slide opened, revealing the top floor. Giant window walls were opposite the elevator, with a desk in the centre. It was the director's office and Emily was here only once in her entire career. This room always put dread into Emily and she disliked it with all her being.
"Why are we-" Emily wanted to ask, but Mary looked at her with serious look and cut off.
"We need to have a talk." She said and went up to the desk. Mary sat down on the director's chair and the name plate on the table read, "Mary Hunt". Emily followed and sat opposite the woman. For a few minutes, Emily just sat there with Mary staring at her. Emily started feeling very uncomfortable and finally asked.
"Why?"
"Wrong question Emily," said Mary in a very serious and strict voice and Emily did not recognize the woman. Mary has transformed.
"What about?" Emily asked shyly.
"Good," said Mary and smiled, but quickly went back to her serious face. "We need to talk about your mother."
"I don't even kno-" argued Emily and got cut off by Mary with a penetrating gaze.
"Yes, I know you don't know," agreed Mary and shuffled some papers on the table. Emily did not remember those being when they entered. Mary gave Emily a paper and she took it. On it was a photograph of a man who Emily knew and wished didn't. It was her grandfather, the man who raised her. Some unpleasent memories were connected to that man.
"My grandfather?" Emily asked and Mary nodded.
"Your grandfather knows the truth about you and your mother," explained Mary and Emily shook her head. She refused, but Mary insisted.
"I can't do that," said Emily and the feeling of panic returned.
"I know," Mary got softer and said it in her sweet voice. Emily felt a bit better, still she couldn't even imagine going back to his house.
"You have to do it," said Mary once again. The clouds were slowly flying past the windows of the office. The office building was high, the highest one in Bertown.
"Why?" asked Emily, wiping off the tears.
"You need to know the truth Emily," answered Mary and took her hands. Mary's soft and warm hands gave hope and Emily nodded.
"Alright," she finally agreed and Mary smiled. Emily yawned and the feeeling of tiredness she felt at the office returned to her. A few moments later, she fell asleep in her dream and woke in the real world.


Part II

Michael River's old, red car pulled up near a coffee shop. The bell above the door rang and a woman in green uniform came up to Michael.
"Hello sir, welcome to Sickly Sweet," greeted him the waitress. "What can I get for you today?"
"I'm just meeting here someone," Michael excused himself while looking over the woman's shoulder for someone. The waitress drooped and went back into the kitchen, mumbling, "Of course you do". Michael did not pay attention to her and sat at the empty table. He took off his hat and looked at his watch. It was nearly twelve and they agreed to meet each other at eleven fifty. Michael was checking his phone once more to see if there were any new messages when a woman in brown coat entered the cafe. She was thin, but rather short with straight, long, brown hair. Her red scarf stood out from the rest of her clothes and especially her blue eyes and Michael immediately recognized her. It was Emily Parkins. He waved to her and she sat at the same table with him.
"Sorry I'm a bit late," said Emily, putting her bag on the table.
"Don't worry, I also came just now," admitted Michael. He has not seen Emily Parkins since high school when they were still dating. After they both graduated, Michael went abroad to study in a university and Emily stayed in Bertown. Now, after so many years, Michael decided to go back to his hometown where he spent most of his life. He arrived just a week ago and received a call from Emily this morning. She asked if he was free this afternoon and they arranged to meet in Sickly Sweet.
"I haven't been in here for ages," said Michael, looking over the old coffee shop. They had their first date here and the place brought back many memories. Unfortunately, it was also the place where they broke up after Michael announced that he was moving. It was painful to part, but Michael was stood his ground. He really wanted to study in that university and Emily did not want to ruin his life. Eventually, she let him ago and they have not seen each other until today.
"Michael," started Emily and he looked at her with curiosity. She was still the same, always thinking about something, hiding her thoughts and feelings from the rest of the world. Even now Michael could see that something was on her mind.
"Yeah," said Michael.
"I need to tell you something," Emily continued. It was difficult for her to talk about this and Michael guessed it was something about her family. Emily lost her mother when she was only three and was raised up by her grandfather, a very cruel person. Her father disappeared after her birth and she didn't even know if he was still alive.
"Go ahead," said Michael and leaned forward to hear better.
"Let's get somewhere private," finally said Emily and Michael agreed. It wasn't a good idea to talk about whatever beared Emily's mind in this cafe. Especially with the annoying waitresses constantly trying to get you to buy something. 

The Bertown's park was a very big and beautiful one, taking most of the space in this little town. It was also the only tourist attraction they had, but tourists rarely came in their town. Most of them were lost, confusing the names of two close town of Bertown and Beartown. Emily and Michael were strolling down the cobbled path. Though it was still winter, the snow was sowly melting, leaving big puddles and mud everywhere. A light breeze was making the trees move from side to side.
"I had a dream a few days ago," said Emily after a long silence. Michael was closely listening to her. The years together taught him that Emily often needed someone who listened.
"I dreamed about this woman," Emily tried to explain. "Her name was Mary Hunt and I know her. She is the janitor in our office."
Emily looked at Michael as if asking if he understood. He nodded and she continued.
"It was more like a vision I suppose," shrugged Emily. "We went up to the director's office and there she told me something I still can't forget." 
Emily took a deep breath and gathered her thoughts.
"She told me that I had to visit my grandfather," said Emily. She closed her eyes for a few moments and took some deep breaths again. Michael stopped and waited for her to calm down.
"Did she tell you why?" asked Michael after they continued walking in the park. A blue bird flew over them and sat down on a branch. It looked at the two people walking with curious little eyes and then flapped its wings and went up into the air.
"Yes," answered Emily. "She told me that he knew the truth about my mother."
They sat down on a bench near a frozen lake. On it was a squirrel with some berries in her paws. It noticed the couple sitting on a bench and decided to try its luck. The little creature put the berries in its mouth and then came up to the humans. With beggining eyes, the squirrel stretched out its little paws asking for food. After not getting anything, the squirrel quickly ran away and went up the tree trunk, hiding in a hollow.
"But it was only a dream, right?" asked Michael waiting for the squirrel to come out.
"I think so," said Emily. "But I feel like my mind was trying to tell me something. That's why I asked you to come."
Emily glanced at Michael who was still looking at the tree where the squirrel was hiding.
"Can you come with me to my grandfather's house?" finally asked Emily. She waited in anticipation.
"Sure," answered Michael and suddenly got up. He walked on the frozen lake and up to the tree. He looked inside the hollow and Emily caught up with him. Inside she saw a squirrel who was looking at the two people with confusion. The little creature gave them its berry and Michael took with a smile. For a split second, Emily thought that she could see the squirrel returning the smile, but it quickly lied down and went to sleep.


Part III:

Michael's car slowly stopped near an old, wooden shack. Its red, tiled roof was visibly damaged and the planks were all damped. All in all, the house looked as if nobody lived in there for ages. Only one person Michael knew would love this dwelling.
Emily and Michael got out of the car. It was past noon, the drive didn't take long. Emily looked at Michael with hope and without saying anything, they knocked. After a few minutes, they heard shuffling from the inside which grew closer.
"Who's that?" a voice asked from behind the door. It was creaky, just like the house and you could hear irritation in it. Emily hesitated and answered.
"It's me," she said. "Emily."
They waited, clouds of steam coming out from their noses. The spring was near, but winter was still the ruler of the weather. Finally, the door opened and a very old man in pajamas looked at the couple. His eyebrows were low, mouth thin and shut. Melvin Reece, Emily's grandfather, was standing in front of them and Emily felt light fear. Many years have passed since she left her grandfather's house and she rarely visited him. He has not changed a single bit since they last met.
"Come on in," said Melvin with no enthusiasm and invited them both into the house. Michael entered after Emily and the old man closed the squeaking door behind them. The house was very dark, most windows were covered with old newspapers. The living room had an old, worn-out couch with a TV in front of it. On a windowsill were clay pots with dead plants in them. The greenery in the house was very old, slowly withering away. After Emily left her grandfather, there was no one left to look after the house.
Michael and Emily went into the kitchen where Melvin was cooking something. Old wooden cupboards begged for some repairs and oil, moaning whenever someone opened them. Melvin put on some plates with stew inside on the table. Emily took a seat next to Michael and Melvin Reece sat opposite them. Neither of them dared to eat as Emily's grandfather examined them with his angry look. The awkward silence was broken by Emily.
"Grandfather," she tried to say confidently, but her voice trembled a bit. "I want to know the truth about my mother."
Emily was stumbling over her words as she tried to confront the man she feared all her life. Melvin did not move a muscule. He looked at Michael with hatred and then switched to Emily.
"I told you everything I know," he said in a cold voice. Melvin seemed more like a robot than a human. Emily glanced at Michael, but he did not know what to do and just shrugged his shoulders. Emily looked down to find courage.
"I had a dream," started Emily, carefully picking each word. "In that dream, one woman told me you know the truth about my mother."
These words seemed to have a big impact on the man as his usual cold eyes changed with shock. Quickly, though, he went back to his normal, annoyed look. He watched them both and then stood up and went up to a window covered in paper.
"What was her name?" he asked without looking.
"Mary Hunt," answered Emily with hope. Melvin swayed a little bit and had to lean against a windowsill. He then looked at Michael and with a gesture ordered him to leave. This conversation was meant only for two of them. Emily watched hopelessly as Michael was closing the door, leaving her and Melvin on their own. Emily startled in surprise when her grandfather sat next to her. Emily tried to look him in the eyes, but his old, wrinkly faced reminded of the bad times. Melvin just sat there, no emotions on his face and only his trembling hands betrayed his worry.
"What did she show you?" asked Melvin out of blue.
"She showed me your photograph," finally answered Emily. She could not endure the penetrating gaze of her grandfather and was trying to look away from him. A long silence, which lasted what felt like ages, was broken by Melvin.
"A long time ago, your mother met a woman," he started. "A woman whose power was not in her beauty or strength or money. Her power was in her mind."
Melvin stopped for a moment, trying to search for the right words. He knew this day would come, but didn't expect it to come this quickly.
"That woman knew how to master the arts of her thoughts. She could do things none of us could. Many of us called her a witch, I personally was one of those people. Your mother however, she trusted her. And that woman taught Ash. She taught her things which scared us, drove us away. I could not withstand that filthy witch take away my daughter. Still, as if by magic, I allowed Ash to visit her."
Melvin took a deep breath and then looked straight into Emily's eyes. She was completely amazed by this story and he didn't even get to the most exciting and painful part.
"Ash grew older and time arrived for her to move away. She still visited me occasionally and one day, she came to my house with a young man. I immediately realised what was happening and, well, what could I do? They were in love. That man was your father, Sawyer Wren. He was very nice and kind and I was proud that your mother chose him above all others who lived in our small town. How wrong I was."
The eyes of Melvin filled with tears and regret, but he continued his story anyway.
"Ash decided to teach Sawyer her powers. The power of mind and thoughts, hoping that he will understand. Hoping that together they can change the world. A fool, your mother was. All power corrupts and the day Sawyer mastered the art, he went mad. At that time, you were born. Your mother wanted to raise you together with Wren, as a family. Sawyer, however, he wanted you all to himself. Your parents argued and that dreadful night, Sawyer promised that he will do anything to get you back. Your mother went back to me, raising you here. But one night, Wren found her and a fight broke out. I grabbed you and ran as far as I could. When we returned, your mother was dead and Sawyer was no where near. For many years I feared that he might return, might come back. But that never happened."
Melvin finished his story and waited for Emily to take it all in. He knew that it was a big shock for her and gave her all the time she needed. Despite him being very strict and cruel to her, Melvin loved Emily with all his heart. She was the only reminder of her daughter and he promised Ash to protect her daughter. He will keep that promise, even if it means death to him. Sawyer might have killed his daughter, but Melvin will not allow him to take away his granddaughter too. Finally, Emily spoke, her voice quiet and weak.
"What about that woman?" she asked.
"That woman's name was Mary Hunt. She visited you in your sleep," explained Melvin. "After she found out what happened, she helped me raise you. When you grew three years old, Mary explained me your power. Your role in this world. She asked me whether she could teach you, but I refused. I could not stand even a small chance of your mother's fate repeating. Mary understood my decision and told me that one day, I will have to tell you the truth. It seems that day has come."

Michael was standing in the back yard of the old house. The old garden was in a poor coniditon and only the old, powerful oak tree was still alive. The branches of it were naked and covered in snow. Soon, the tree buds will grow and leaves will appear everywhere, marking the beginning of spring. A blue bird flew over Michael head and sat down on a branch. Its little, charcoal black eyes seemed to be staring right into his soul. Michael watched the bird raise its wings and moments later, fly away. A branch crunched behind him and he turned around, expecting to see Emily. Instead, a man with hair combed backwards was standing near him. He was wearing blue jacket with jeans, despite it being cold outside. Michael could see his teeth, as the man was smiling in a sly grin.
"Who are you?" asked Michael with alarm. How could a stranger sneak into the back yard?
"I'm your friend Michael," the man said in a hoarse voice. Although the stranger seemed young, Michael could see in his eyes great wisdom.
"How did you get here?" Michael tried to question the man again.
"Oh," the man waved away, "I'm just Melvin's old friend. Emily's uncle."
"She never told me about you," said Michael with suspicion.
"Of course she didn't," the man chuckled, "I only saw her when she was a small, little angel."
The man in a blue jacket drew closer to Michael, sly grin on his face.
"My name's Sawyer Wren," the man stretched out hand. Michael carefully shook it. The man still not trustworthy.
"What do you want from me?" asked Michael. He looked over Sawyer's shoulder, inside the house, but all the windows were covered in newspapers. Even if Emily or her grandfather were there, they would not see them.
"What's your name, young man?" asked Wren.
"Michael."
"Michael," started Sawyer, putting his arm around Michael's shoulder. Michael tried to slip away from his grip, but couldn't.
"I know what you want Michael," said Wren with a clever look. Michael looked at him with confusion.
"You," said Sawyer, holding the word for a few seconds and then pointing right into Michael's chest, "Are in love."
Sawyer chuckled, his laugh turning into wheezing. He then started circling Michael, which made his head spin.
"But," Wren raised his finger in the air, "Emily doesn't love you."
"How do you know?" argued Michael, but deep inside he knew Wren was telling the truth. Sawyer laughed again and then continued circling.
"It doesn't matter," he answered. "What matters is that I can make her love you too."
He whispered that into Michael's ear and a sly grin appeared on his face once again. Wren was staring right into Michael's soul, waiting for him to respond.
"So?" Wren finally asked. "I can help you, if you help me. Deal?"
Sawyer stretched out his arm towards Michael. Michael hesitated. He looked over Wren's shoulder, but the house was still silent. It seemed that Emily and her grandfather were still talking. What should he do? If only she was here.
"Deal," said Michael and shook Sawyer's hand.


Part IV:

She was walking along a lonely road. The trees on either side were growing thicker, taller as she walked farther down. A woman she recognized was collecting berries from a bush. Her long, wavy, red hair were lying on her shoulders and the old lady fixed them when she turned. Her red lips closed in a friendly smile as she saw Emily. Mary Hunt put down the basket full of berries and hugged Emily.
"I'm dreaming again, aren't I?" asked Emily and Mary nodded. The two women continued walking along the foggy road, collecting berries on their way.
"How did it go?" Mary asked. Emily was silent for a few minutes. Her grandfather's word still echoed in her mind. 
"Your father," he said, "Wants to take over the world."
How could her father do such thing? Emily never knew him, her grandfather refused to tell anything about that man. And today, he told her everything. Her head was throbbing with pain, the headache was getting worse. Emily gently touched her forehead and then finally spoke.
"I don't even know," she answered. Mary Hunt looked at her, smile disappearing off her face. Emily tried to smile, pretending that she was okay, but she just couldn't hide the shock.
"Your father was a good man," said Mary after a long silence. The road seemed to be infinite, the trees on both sides hiding the two women from the rest of the world.
"But he killed my mother," argued Emily in a low voice. She was saying that to herself, rather than her companion.
"He did not," suddenly said Mary. Her voice was stronger and cold, but not too loud, just like that time in the office. Emily looked at her, this time not being afraid. She knew that Mary meant her well, even if she did sometimes become like her grandfather.
"Then, who?" asked Emily. She put her arms around herself, trying to comfort what was left of her nerves.
"Your father has been long dead," declared Mary. She was looking down on the asphalt. The weather was becoming more foggy and it became difficult to see what was ahead.
"His soul at least."
"What do you mean?" asked Emily. She was still hugging herself, but now it was because of the cold that came with the fog.
"Emily," finally spoke Mary after whispering something to herself. Her head was still down, tears started rolling down her cheeks.
"There are forces in this world that mean you real harm."
"What?" Emily asked with confusion. She couldn't understand what Mary was trying to say. It was also getting extremely cold and even with her white sweater, her teeth began rattling. Mary, however, the cold seemed to avoid.
"Emily," Mary stopped and looked at Emily. "You need to kill your father."

The car hit a bump and Emily woke right up. They stopped near her office and Michael turned around and spoke.
"We're here," he said and unfastened his belt. Emily's face was unusually gloomy and Michael noticed that. He said something, but Emily ignored his words. She exited the car and briefly said goodbye to Michael and then went on her way. She didn't understand where she was going, but when Emily finally woke up from her trance, she was at home. Emily took off her coat, reached for her neck and gasped. Emily came up to a mirror and fear squeezed her chest. It was difficult to breathe and the whole world started falling apart. The light breeze outside, the rustling of trees, everything seemed to be laughing at her. The entire world turned against Emily. She quickly opened the door and ran onto the streets.
The sun was slowly setting and dark shadows started creeping out from every corner. Emily ran blindly, forgetting everything she ever knew. She needed to find her scarf, her mother's scarf. Emily turned every corner, checked every bin, asked everyone she met. The frightened people tried to politely excuse themselves and then get the hell away from her, but Emily didn't care. Then, she remembered Michael. Emily took out her phone and speed dialed him. 
One beep. 
She waited, sweat running from her forehead. 
Two beeps. 
Michael was still not answering his phone. 
Three beeps. 
Emily couldn't hold it anymore and she continued running despite her tiredness. Her legs were heavy, but Emily carried on her way. She didn't know where Michael was staying and just wandered around the town until completely running out of breath. It was already dark, the sun has long gone away. Emily didn't know how long she was outside, but the cold was already getting to her bones. She began shivering, her coat she forgot at home. Then, Emily realised something much more horrifying. She was alone and silver fog began to surround her from everywhere. She knew what was happening and the bitter truth hit her like a fright train. Without scarf, Emily was unprotected. And this time, there was no one to save her.
"You guessed it," a low, hoarsing voice said from behind her. Emily was too scared to turn around, her body wasn't listening to her. Her head was throbbing with pain, she was shaking chills. Then, a sudden, sharp pain stroke her chest. Sawyer stabbed Emily right into her heart. Still, no blood spilled from her chest, letting Emily know she was dreaming.
"Where's your mother now?" laughed Wren from behind. Emily felt a certain cold creeping into her heart, eating on her soul and very being. She tried to fight it, but the fatigue made it difficult. Eventually, Emily gave up and fell onto the ground. She could see her father's face before falling into a deep, dreameless sleep.

Michael gripped Emily's scarf tighter in his hand. He was still regretting doing so, but a deal was a deal. After all, it was only a scarf. He was going to return it as soon as he could, under the pretext that Emily simply left it in his car. Soon, Michael turned around a corner and found himself in a narrow, dirty street. Sawyer's house was a bit farther down the road and Michael finally found it, he pulled up and left the car. He decided to keep it running, he wasn't planning on staying here long. Michael went up a flight of stairs and rang the doorbell. Someone from inside the house went downstairs with heavy steps and opened the door. It was Wren in his usual denim jacket and jeans and with a sly smile. Michael hated this man, but Sawyer was a very charming man. Michael just couldn't refuse to him in that garden.
"You're just in time," said Wren and invited Michael in. After they were both in the house, Michael noticed that Wren locked the door. He checked that his pocket knife was still with him. He bringed it just in case, Sawyer was still very suspicious. 
"So," continued Wren, sitting down on a couch and offering Michael to do the same. Michael followed, but sat on the opposite side from Wren.
"I see you have the scarf," said Sawyer and looked at it. Michael was still holding it in his hand and the grip became tighter.
"Hand it to me," Wren ordered in a cold voice. Michael hesitated for a few seconds, but then finally gave it to the man. Sawyer chuckled and then hid the scarf somewhere behind the couch. He then stood up and started walking around the house. Michael was watching him closely, observing his movements. A blue bird sat down on a windowsill outside the house and knocked on the window a few times with its beak. Michael turned around to see where the noise was coming from and got hit on his face. He plummeted on the ground and immediately lost consciousness.
Sawyer went up to Michael and took out his pocket knife. He won't be needing that anymore. His part of the deal was done. Wren looked at the blue bird and smiled. The bird answered him the same.


Part V:

The office was empty, only electric lamps filled the ghostly corridors with their buzzing. Emily lay at her desk, her long hair falling over her shoulders. The blue glow of the computer provided a faint light, but Emily woke up from her deep sleep. She straightened her hair and looked around. Her head was just throbbing with pain and she remembered what had happened to her. Fear squeezed her chest and she threw herself from her seat and began to run around the empty building. Calling out Mary's name, Emily found herself at the front door. She looked around and, not finding a better choice, moved forward.
The cold air cut her lungs, and a dense, gray fog covered the street like a warm blanket. But it did not give much warmth, on the contrary, it seemed to suck the remnants of strength from Emily. For a second, she thought she saw a figure in the middle of the street, but the silhouette quickly disappeared. She followed the person and heard a familiar voice.
"This way," said Mary from the mist. It was hard to see her through the fog, but Emily noticed her long, curly hair. She quickly followed the woman and found herself in some dark alley. Here the fog parted. And when Emily finally saw her companion, her heart sank into her heels.
"That's right," a husky voice said, and Sawyer Wren turned to face Emily. He didn't seem to age, and Emily wasn't sure how old her father was. His entire appearance seemed to be frozen in time, the same denim jacket and the same dark jeans. His jet-black hair was slicked back.
"Emily," Sawyer began, but Emily turned and ran as far as she could. But despite all her attempts, she ended up in the same alley where Sawyer was already waiting for her. He had an orange in his hands and he slowly peeled it, and when Emily ran to him again, he offered her a piece. She said nothing and he shrugged his shoulders and ate it himself.
"What do you want?" Emily asked. Her voice trembled, her heart was beating wildly, and her legs could barely hold.
"I only need one thing," Sawyer replied coldly, still chewing on his orange. He gestured for Emily to wait and swallowed it. Clearing his throat, he continued.
"You," he finally said. Emily realized that it was useless to run and hesitantly approached Sawyer. Wren raised an eyebrow and decided to wait what his daughter would do. Emily jumped towards Sawyer and punched him right in the face. He recoiled and touched his wound. He looked at Emily with a smile and decided to play along. He began to run away from her, and Emily, in a fit of rage, chased after him. A dark alley lined up right in front of their eyes, but eventually led to another dead end. Emily immediately seized the opportunity and hit her father again. She hated this man, hated him with all her soul. She has never been so angry and it would seem that the former, shy and quiet Emily is in the past. Finally, Sawyer punched Emily lightly in the stomach, but it was enough to wake her up from her rage. She looked at her bloody fists and then at her father. Despite his condition, the smile never left his face.
"You're as naive as your mother," Sawyer said, and vanished right before Emily's eyes.

Emily woke and saw Michael's body lying on the floor. It was in wounds many of which were still fresh and Emily quickly realised what Sawyer was trying to achieve. She saw if Michael was still breathing and then ran into the bathroom. She brought some bandages and started washing the stratches and cuts. She with much care tended to the Michael who was coming round. He rose up on his shoulders to see what was going and fell back down feeling sharp pain in his abdomen.
"Don't move," whispered Emily as she was bandaging his leg. When she was finished, she helped Michael get up on the couch. They both sat in silence for a while, both deep in their thoughts and spoke at the same time.
"How did I get here?" asked Michael and Emily at the same time. They looked at each other and smiled, but their smiles quickly faded. Michael noticed a big bruise on Emily's face and asked her whether she was okay.
"Yeah," faintly answered Emily. She was afraid to tell what happened to her and Michael appeared to understand that.
"Emily," started Michael. It was difficult for him to speak, the stomach still hurt on every breath but he ignored the pain.
"I took your scarf," he finally uttered and looked at Emily with embarassement.
"Why?" was the only thing that Emily managed to ask. Michael looked down onto the ground, his face dark, brows lowered.
"One man promised that he will help me if I did so," answered Michael. Emily was stunned and she carefully picked the right words.
"Was his name Sawyer Wren?" asked Emily and Michael looked at her with wild eyes.
"How do you know?"
"Michael," said Emily in a trembling voice. She fixed her hair and then touched her lips and continued.
"We have to talk."
Michael nodded and prepared to listen to Emily's story. When she finished telling him what she found out from her grandfather, both were in deep shock. The ticking of the clock seemed to be incredibly loud in the dead silence that appeared in the room. What seemed to be ages turned out to only be a few minutes, but no words were spoken during that time. Both were still sitting on the couch and only occasional gasps of pain from Michael filled the room with sounds. Emily was angry at Michael, but at the same time she knew that she needed him. There was no way Emily could beat her father alone, seeing as he managed to persuade Michael to do such a thing. Only Michael knew why Emily was so attached to her scarf and now that he knew the true value of scarf to Emily, he was feeling twice as ashamed. Emily looked at him, however her eyes were not filled with anger or rage, but with tears. She suddenly hugged Michael and started sobbing and Michael tried his best to calm her down. Sometimes words are uneccessary.

Sawyer Wren was sitting in his lounge, looking at Michael's gift. That foolish little brat didn't even know what he's done and that's for the best. Still, Sawyer didn't manage to break those two apart despite his best efforts. He was okay with that, Sawyer still had his ace in the hole.
The red, silk scarf was in his hands and even now Sawyer could feel what power it held. Ash Ridge, that damned woman was the one who knitted it by her own hands. In its thread was hiding great strength which Sawyer was planning to use. With it and Emily, Wren would be unstoppable and he will finally turn his plan to action. The world has been slowly collapsing for the past century and Sawyer's dream was to stop it. Using the power of his wife and daughter combined, Sawyer will manage to do what no other can. He will bend the wills of the world rulers and they will do whatever he says. With that, Sawyer will lead the world into a bright future, a future where everyone will know him. Where everyone will worship him as a king. Nay, as a god. 
Sawyer's grip on the scarf tightened and his lips closed in a smile, one that makes any woman swoon. Now that Emily has nothing to protect her, it wouldn't be hard to get hold of her. The only problem was that annoying little man named Michael, but even he won't be able to resist the charm of Sawyer Wren.
"Soon," Wren thought to himself, "Soon."


Part VI:

The blades of grass were gently touching the woman's legs as she hazily walked through the field. She was dreaming, eyes shut and whispering something under her breath. Another woman, much older and with red, curly hair appeared from behind and began walking along. Mary Hunt touched Ash's hand which put her out of her trance. Ash Ridge smiled, the white dress she was wearing that night was clean and new and the woman didn't seem to age. Her brown hair were long, falling on her shoulders. Her beautiful, blue eyes were twinkled with joy and wit.
"I thought you were busy," she finally said to her teacher, Mary Hunt. Mary chuckled and waved away.
"My work can always wait Ash," she said with a smile and the two women walked up a mighty, old oak tree. The cloud covering the sky made everything around gloomy and light breeze appeared out of nowhere, swaying the swings attached to the oak. Ash sat down and started swinging to and fro.
"I suppose you know why I called you," said Mary and Ash nodded. The wind blew stronger, the clouds became greyer, feeling the dreadful news.
"What are we going to do?" asked Ash still swinging.
"My dear," replied Mary, "We can't do anything."
Ash stopped swaying and got up. She looked at her teacher with worrisome gaze.
"Why?" she asked to which Mary simply shook her head. She crossed her arms and leaned on the oak.
"Ash," Mary said gently, "Emily has to do it by herself."
"But Mary," argued Ash and the wind grew even wilder. The oak started moaning under such force and the clouds up in the sky glided with incredible speed. Somewhere in the distance a lightning stroke and thunder soon followed afterwards.
"Ash," Mary said this time with much force in her voice, "She has to do it alone."
Ash sat down back on the swings and put her hands on her face. Light droplets and water fell from the sky and soon it was raining heavily. But Mary stood there, arms crossed, with emotionless face and waited for Ash to finish. Soon enough, the rain stopped and wind stopped blowing, the sky became clearer.
"But she needs my help," said Ash.
"She can do it herself," argued Mary. Mary Hunt, the teacher of Ash Ridge, was famously known to be cold and unaffectionate even in the old times of Bertown. Her childhood she spent in a small village a bit to the north from Bertown, but it is now long abandoned. After growing up and learning the arts of mind, Mary moved to Bertown to find and teach young girls. However, keeping her school a secret was extremely difficult and before long, the news broke out. Many of the citizens called her a witch, some even wanted to hang her. Mary was a woman of strength and will and it was hard to break her down. She did not run, on the contrary, she stayed nad fought back. After a while, the citizens of Bertown accept her though many hated that decision.
"What if she dies?" asked Ash and the thought of that was enough to make her gasp.
"Then that is her faith," answered Mary coldly. Ash never understood why Mary was so cold and at the same times so caring. Mary often switched between those two states which always caught Ash off guard.
Ash was silent for a few moments, the two women looking at each other. Then Mary started walking and Ash quickly followed. 
"Why do you care for her so much?" suddenly asked Mary and the question baffled Ash. She thought for a few moments and replied with certainty.
"She is my daughter."
"So?" Mary did not let up. She looked at Ash waiting for a response.
"There's nothing more to it," Ash finally answered, "I care simply because she is my daughter."
They walked for a bit in silence as the wind started to rise again, shuffling the fallen leaves. Soon, the wind began blewing at a monstrous speed. And out of the mist stepped a figure of a tall man, with jet-black hair and with an orange in hands. The two women stopped, the storm blowing into their backs and waving their dresses.
"Sawyer," spoked Mary squinting her eyes.
"Mary, long time no see!" replied Sawyer Wren in a friendly matter and spreaded his arms. Ash took a step back while Mary stood still. The two looked at each other with hating gazes, Sawyer with the signature smile on his face, Mary with lips tight shut.
"Why such a dry greeting?" sarcastically asked Sawyer and Mary Hunt clenched her hands into fists.
"You are not worth a friendly greeting Wren and you know it," responded Mary and Sawyer chuckled.
"That's good one," he said and tossed the orange to the other hand. Sawyer took a bite of an unpeeled orange.
"Why you came here?" asked Mary. Ash was standing behind her back, fearing the power of her ex-husband. It took Ash a lot of nerves to fight him and cost her life.
"I came here just to chat," replied Sawyer mundanely. He took another bite with an unchanging expression on his face despite the sourness of the fruit.
"Don't you lie to me," said Mary seeing through Wren's lie.
"Ah! you got me," jokingly replied Sawyer and raised his hands in the air. Mary did not appreciate the joke, rather she hated Sawyer for his bad comedy.
"You're right," continued Wren, "I came here for another reason. You."
"Well," answered Mary, "Go ahead, I'm right here."
"Mary," Sawyer leaned his head, "I'm nobody's fool."
"You mean you were made in 1994?" sardonically asked Mary.
"What?" asked Sawyer with confusion.
"What?" echoed Mary. Sawyer shot a glance of hatred at Mary but continued after the interruption.
"I know how powerful you are and my precious little wife is here too," he looked at Ash still hiding behind Mary. Ash heard her name and peaked over Mary's shoulder but stayed motionless.
"So you're afraid?"
"No, Mary," replied Sawyer and finished his orange. The wind was still blowing with powerful speed but both Sawyer and Mary were unaffected by it.
"I'm just offering you to surrender beforehand."
"Never," drily replied Mary. Her eyes were fixed at Sawyer, watching his every move. She knew this man and his tricks.
"Well then," said Sawyer and the wind turned into a hurricane, pulling out even the mighty, old oak from the ground. "That's on you."
After that, Sawyer disappeaed into the fog and the wind stopped blowing. The giant tree fell to the ground with a giant crash. Ash and Mary were standing still a brief moment after which Ash was brave enough to come out of her cover.`
